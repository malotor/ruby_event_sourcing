# EventSourcing

The fundamental idea of Event Sourcing is that of ensuring every change to the state of an application is captured in an event object, and that these event objects are themselves stored in the sequence they were applied for the same lifetime as the application state itself.

This gem provides a simple way for add events sourcing related behaviour to your models class.

Base classes

- AggregateRoot
- Event
- EventStream
- EventPublisher

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_event_sourcing'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_event_sourcing

## Usage

Here an example of use:

```ruby
class Employee

  include SimpleEventSourcing::AggregateRoot

  attr_reader :name, :title, :salary

  def initialize(args = nil )
    super
    unless args.nil?
      apply_record_event  NewEmployeeIsHiredEvent.new(@aggregate_id, args[:name], args[:title], args[:salary] )
    end
  end

  def salary=(new_salary)
    apply_record_event SalaryHasChangedEvent.new(@aggregate_id, new_salary)
  end

  on NewEmployeeIsHiredEvent do |event|
    @name = event.name
    @title = event.title
    @salary = event.salary
  end

  on SalaryHasChangedEvent do |event|
    @salary = event.new_salary
  end

  def save
    # Persist the entity
    publish_events { |event| SimpleEventSourcing::EventPublisher.publish(event) }
  end

end
```

First, you must add behaviour including the AggregateRoot module

```ruby
  include SimpleEventSourcing::AggregateRoot
```

You must create your own domain events and a event stream

```ruby
class EmployeeStreamEvents < SimpleEventSourcing::StreamEvents
  def get_aggregate_class
    Employee
  end
end

class SalaryHasChangedEvent < SimpleEventSourcing::Event
  attr_reader :aggregate_id, :new_salary

  def initialize(aggregate_id, new_salary)
    @aggregate_id = aggregate_id
    @new_salary = new_salary
    super()
  end
end
```

After that all domain event must be applied and recorded

```ruby
apply_record_event SalaryHasChangedEvent.new(@aggregate_id, new_salary)
```

SimpleEventSourcing provides a DSL to handle the applied events. You must provide a handler for each event

```ruby
on SalaryHasChangedEvent do |event|
  @salary = event.new_salary
end
```



Once you persist the entity you must publish all recorded events.

```ruby
  def save
    # Persist the entity
    publish_events { |event| SimpleEventSourcing::EventPublisher.publish(event) }
  end
```

Happy coding!
